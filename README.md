# Introduction

The FIFA - MoneyBall project is a comprehensive analysis of the FIFA 21 dataset using statistical and machine learning techniques. The dataset provides extensive information about player attributes, club details, performance statistics, and market values. This project aims to derive valuable insights from the data, including player rankings, top-performing players, player transfer decisions, and more.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the fifa21_male2.csv dataset, which contains a wealth of information about FIFA 21 players. It includes the following key features:

- Player Name;
- Club of the Player;
- League;
- Position;
- Player attributes such as Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, and Physical;
- Additional player information such as Date of Birth, Nationality, Height, Foot, Day Joined the current club, Day of Contract End, Market Value of the Player;
- Social media data including the number of followers on Instagram and number of likes on Facebook of the club in which the player has a contract;
-Performance data from ESPN FC from the past 5 years including Games Started, Games Substituted, Goals Scored, Assists, Shots, Shots on Goal, Fouls Committed, Fouls Suffered, Yellow Cards, and Red Cards.

# Objectives

The primary objectives of the FIFA - MoneyBall project are as follows:

- Rank players by market value: Utilize the market value information to determine the relative value of players in the FIFA 21 dataset;
- Identify top players based on outstanding performances: Analyze performance statistics to identify players who have excelled in a discrete; season, providing insights into their exceptional abilities;
- Make decisions regarding player transfers: Utilize relevant player attributes and performance data to make informed decisions on when to transfer a player;
- Determine the best replacement for a transferred player: Employ machine learning techniques to identify suitable replacements for transferred players based on various attributes and performance indicators;
- Explore additional outcomes: Based on the analysis, propose and explore additional interesting aspects of the dataset to extract valuable insights.

# Methodology

The FIFA - MoneyBall project follows a structured methodology to achieve its objectives:

- Planning: Develop a well-organized project plan;
- Data exploration and cleaning: Thoroughly explore the dataset, identify missing values or inconsistencies, and perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality;
- Data analysis: Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to answer research questions and gain meaningful insights from the data;
- Visualization: Create visually appealing and informative graphs and visualizations to present the findings in a clear and concise manner;
- Model development: Build machine learning models to predict player market values or identify suitable replacements for transferred players, leveraging relevant features and performance data;
- Documentation and presentation: Prepare a comprehensive Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, including detailed comments, methodology, and visualizations. Create a PowerPoint presentation to summarize the project and effectively communicate the key findings.

# Deliverables

- Well-commented Jupyter notebook: The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the FIFA 21 dataset, including data cleaning steps, statistical and machine learning techniques applied, and visualizations of the findings;
- Final dataset: A clean and transformed version of the original dataset, ready for analysis;
- Repository: A GitHub repository containing the project workflow, documentation, code, and the Jupyter notebook.
